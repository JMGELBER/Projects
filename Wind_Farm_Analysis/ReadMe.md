## Project 

* EDA_Wind_Farm: is an exploratory analysis of the data from a wind farm 
* Predicting_Power_Output:  Is doing a regression analysis to predict wind power on the farm given wind speed 
* Forecasting_Wind_Speed: Using historical weather information to develop a forecasting model that
forecasts the future wind speed on the farm. Then using that forecasted wind speed to predict the wind power output for the same
time interval.
