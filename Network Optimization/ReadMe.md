<hr>

* This project was completed in Python using the Pandas, and NetworkX package
* This project involved designing a low-cost network to handle a set of demands between various pairs of cities that are subjected to a constraint
* The constraint was that the route between each pair of cities cannot be excessively long
* COST = nk + distance(i,j) *usage (i,j)
